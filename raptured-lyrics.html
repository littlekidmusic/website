well, i thought that you’d been raptured<br>
came home early from the factory<br>
to find your favourite floral patterned<br>
gown<br>
<br>
just lyin in the doorway<br>
clashed with the colours of the floorin<br>
they’ve got you singin in the chorus<br>
now<br>
<br>
wondered what made me the sinner<br>
never been a perfect christian<br>
but ain't i prayed and been forgiven<br>
lord?<br>
<br>
and i've worked to make a livin<br>
and provided for my children<br>
and wore the knuckles of my fingers<br>
raw<br>
<br>
and i don't go in for drinkin<br>
or carry on with other women<br>
haven't smoked since you got pregnant<br>
babe<br>
<br>
so how could i be made a sinner?<br>
left down here among the livin<br>
the unwashed and the imprisoned<br>
the ones who did and said they didn't<br>
while you're in heaven with the risen<br>
lord?<br>
<br>
i was snapped out of my dreamin<br>
as if someone dragged a needle<br>
across the record that was reelin<br>
on<br>
<br>
playin muffled through that speaker<br>
where an unfamiliar t-shirt<br>
and an empty pairs of jeans were<br>
thrown<br>
<br>
wonderin if you could be the sinner<br>
left down here among the livin<br>
all the unrepentant millions<br>
who admit that they’ve committed<br>
somethin they cannot be forgiven<br>
for<br>
<br>
and your camisole and leggings<br>
made a path towards the bedroom<br>
that i followed like a breadcrumb<br>
trail<br>
<br>
and on the wall there was a dead man<br>
nailed above the creakin headboard<br>
and as i watched his limbs were spreadin<br>
out<br>
<br>
and he looked down on the bed there<br>
at the tangle of the flesh there<br>
where your souls were intermeshin<br>
as if you were brought to heaven<br>
with your dress still on the kitchen<br>
floor<br>

<br><br>
