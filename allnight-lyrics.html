how can i live with myself<br>
without pretendin i’m anyone else?<br>
anyone else would have left right away<br>
but i learned my parts and i took to the stage
<br><br>
we signed that contract in blood<br>
we were impatient and we were in love<br>
in love with the lights and the road<br>
but some things still follow wherever you go
<br><br>
they want us to sing them that song<br>
about our love long dead and gone<br>
and if they won’t hold their applause<br>
baby the show must go on
<br><br>
all night
<br><br>
confusin the present and past<br>
i place my hand on the small of your back<br>
i’m back in that house where we lived<br>
the ring and the finger and formin a fist
<br><br>
they want us to sing them that song<br>
about our love long dead and gone<br>
and if they won’t hold their applause<br>
baby the show must go on
<br><br>
all night
