when you got back<br>
you went down to that track<br>
to watch the dogs<br>
you’d saved some cash<br>
for first and last<br>
but you were trashed and you were stoned<br>
you casually picked<br>
a random dog from the list<br>
said “that’s the one”<br>
but at the sound of that gun<br>
already knew in your gut<br>
you’d lost it all
<br><br>
it really is amazing<br>
i don’t know how you do it<br>
never much for playing but<br>
you’ve always had a way<br>
with losing
<br><br>
when i got back<br>
i was surprised to cross paths<br>
with the one i love<br>
there was a time<br>
i used to call her mine<br>
but life is long<br>
and i got tired<br>
of sharin my light<br>
so i took off<br>
right away<br>
i knew i’d made a mistake<br>
but she was gone
<br><br>
it really is amazing<br>
i don’t know how you do it<br>
hardly even playing but<br>
you’ve always had a way<br>
with losing
<br><br>
it really is amazing<br>
i don’t know how you do it<br>
never much for playing but<br>
you’ve always had a way<br>
with losing
