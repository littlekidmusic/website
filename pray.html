On July 3rd, 2020, a visitor to the farm received the following messages from the Blessed Mother.

<br><br>

For Children: DO NOT SUBMIT YOURSELVES TO <a href="http://littlekid.bandcamp.com/merch">WORLDLY CONSOLATIONS</a>.

<br><br>

For Youth: KEEP YOUR HEARTS PURE. REFRAIN FROM <a href="http://littlekid.bandcamp.com/merch">WORLDLY DESIRES</a>. LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF MY SON, JESUS.

<br><br>

For Parents: INSTILL IN THE HEARTS OF OUR CHILDREN THE WORDS OF MY SON. TEACH THEM THE LOVE THAT YOU HAVE PROMISED TO EACH OTHER. KEEP FROM SHOWERING THEM WITH <a href="http://littlekid.bandcamp.com/merch">MATERIAL THINGS</a>.
